    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Education is the <b>foundation</b> of every successful society. It helps students 
        to <strong>develop knowledge</strong>, <i>learn discipline</i>, and prepare for their 
        future goals. A good education shapes a student’s mind and allows them to 
        <em>think critically</em> about the world around them. 
        <u>Without education</u>, it is hard to achieve success in any field.<br />
        Learning never ends; it continues from school to life experiences.
